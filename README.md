# Introduction

You've been invited to complete this coding assignment. We deliberately keep the assignment vague leaving much room for you to make choices. Please explain your design choices. Feel free to implement this in your own preferred tech stack.
We do not expect you to spend days on this nor to build a full-blown application.

Good luck!

## Assignment

Please build a solution where you parse the xml files and build a report which contains the hourly energy values, the price per hour and the sum of energy and price per meter.
